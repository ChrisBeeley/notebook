While I remember, here is a very quick list of things to do when you're using Hugo to make websites so they work properly.

* Configure config.toml so that the baseURL points to the actual location- either online or in your file system
    * This doesn't sound like much but it won't render properly unless you do this- even if using `hugo server` does render nicely
* Install dependencies if necessary with npm install

I'm using three different themes, I'll list them all and talk about how to set them up another time

* Terminal
* Geek docs
* Notebook (this one)
