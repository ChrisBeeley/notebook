# Data saves lives: reshaping health and social care with data

This [report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-saves-lives-reshaping-health-and-social-care-with-data/data-saves-lives-reshaping-health-and-social-care-with-data) will be quoted and remixed according to the terms of the [Open Government Licence](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/)- as always I would like to express my gratitude that this is being used because reading, summarising, quoting, and citing stuff that doesn't have an open licence can be a real pain in the neck.

## Introduction

> The future of the NHS depends on improving how we use data for 4 related purposes:
> 1. For the direct care of individuals.
> 1. To improve population health through the proactive targeting of services.
> 1. For the planning and improvement of services.
> 1. For the research and innovation that will power new medical treatments.
