# What can NHS-R do?

## Complete list of relevant commitments

* Supporting local and national decision makers with data
    * We will develop an online Analytics Hub, working with AnalystX, to share, promote and endorse training, events and other resources aimed at analysts and non-analysts across all career levels.
    * We will grow the AnalystX community and build the team of future analytical leaders through a champions programme.
    * We will continue to encourage innovation and collaborative working through a data and analytics accelerator by promoting the use of open data, and working with a plurality of solutions and teams. The principles of the accelerator will be tested through hackathons and real business cases.
    * We will develop and roll out a unified set of competency frameworks aligned to the government analysis function skills, and the digital, data and technology profession.
    * Through the Developing Data and Analysis as a Profession Board, we will:
        * agree frameworks, guidelines and policies to support the analytical community and address the concerns raised in the Goldacre review
        * build the ecosystem of the profession through communities of practice (local, regional, national and virtual)
        * signpost and provide development opportunities for analysts in both health and social care
    * We will begin to make new source code that we produce or commission open and reusable by default (with clear exceptions) and publish it under appropriate licences to encourage further innovation (such as MIT and OGLv3, alongside suitable open data sets or dummy data). Subject to consultation, the relevant policies will also aim to be open and reusable.
    * We will consult with the UKRI and NIHR to consider how outputs from research they fund involving health and care data can follow open and reusable code principles.
    * Our public health agencies will draw on multiple data sources to gain new insights into the publicâ€™s health, with quicker access to high-quality health intelligence to inform improved decision-making and responses to threats to health.
* Empowering researchers with the data they need to develop life-changing treatments, diagnostics, models of care and insights
    * We will create partnerships between academic researchers, charities, patient advocacy groups, industry and analytical teams to enhance the exchange of skills and knowledge.
    * We will publish a digital playbook on how to open source your code for health and care organisations. Guidance on where to put the code, how to license and maintain it, and best practice for working with suppliers will be published in addition to case studies of teams who have done this.
    * We will undertake further work on using data to improve health outcomes and reduce health disparities, including through the AI Ethics Initiative. The initiative will report in 2023 to 2024 on its joint research call with the Health Foundation exploring how to use AI-driven technologies to improve health outcomes for ethnic minority populations in the UK.
