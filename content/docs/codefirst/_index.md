## Background

There is a strong case for increasing the use of code first analytics in government (e.g. in the analytic function's [RAP strategy](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/reproducible-analytical-pipelines-strategy/)) as well as in [the NHS](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0141076820930666), with the recently published [Goldacre review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/better-broader-safer-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis), in particular, being enthusiastically received by healthcare staff, with many of its recommendations being accepted in the recent DHSC policy [Data Saves Lives](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-saves-lives-reshaping-health-and-social-care-with-data/data-saves-lives-reshaping-health-and-social-care-with-data). RAP here refers to a method of code based analytics which minimises manual steps, instead expressing all data and analytic operations in code which can be freely rerun and inspected during and after the analysis.

Another important dimension of the recommendations of the RAP strategy and the Goldacre review is the potential for the sharing of code to radically improve the transparency, accuracy, and efficiency of analytic work, even sharing within organisations but especially sharing between organisations.

There are many individuals and groups across the NHS who are carrying out excellent work using code first and RAP compliant tools, and indeed the Goldacre review names both [NHS-R](https://nhsrcommunity.com/) and [NHSPycom](https://nhs-pycom.net/) as being excellent community  projects bringing together users of these tools. However, it is clear that these practices are far from widespread- many analysts lack the skills and support to use these tools, and even some of those who do have the skills are forbidden to do so on corporate IT equipment
