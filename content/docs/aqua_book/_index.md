## Guidance on producing quality analysis for government

This work was commissioned in 2012 in the wake of the ["difficulties with the Intercity West Coast franchise competition"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterCity_West_Coast)

## Roles and responsibilities

There are three roles in assuring analysis:

* commissioning analysis
* providing analytical assurance
* delivering the analysis itself

### Commissioning analysis

> The person commissioning analysis must ensure that those doing the analysis understand
the context of the question being asked so that they understand the likely risks and can
determine what the appropriate analytical and quality assurance response should be. The
commissioner has a role to ensure that there is sufficient time and resource for the required level
of assurance to be delivered and that they understand the associated risks when time and
resource pressures are unavoidable

### Providing analytical assurance

> The person responsible for providing analytical assurance must ensure they receive evidence
that appropriate analytical quality assurance activities have been conducted and that residual
uncertainties and risks are understood and are communicated. Typically this would be done by a
senior analyst or analytical project manager who is not one of the analysts delivering the
analysis. This activity takes place throughout the life cycle of the analysis from understanding the
problem, through designing the analytical approach, conducting the analysis and relaying the
outputs.

### Delivering analysis

> The people responsible for delivering the analysis frequently assist the commissioner in
structuring the question in order to ensure the appropriate analysis is performed. Some analysis
may require external specialists and therefore analysts may also have responsibilities as part of
the procurement process. Analysts, including those 3 rd parties providing analysis, should also
provide proportionate documentation that outlines the verification and validation activities
undertaken and the associated conclusion

## Quality assurance

Quality assurance comes from two main requirements:

* Environment
    * "creating the conditions in which quality assurance processes can
operate effectively, facilitated by a culture that values quality assurance and
welcomes effective challenge, a well understood chain of responsibility and
sufficient time for quality assurance"
* Process
    * "establishing a clear process for every stage of the analytical life-cycle. This
includes working alongside the commissioner and any other users to ensure there is
a shared understanding about the purpose and any limitations of the analysis"

### Environment

> * a culture where quality assurance is highly valued, and there are strong incentives
to deliver appropriate quality assurance, backed by effective scrutiny of analysis,
supporting models, assumptions and data
> * capacity and capability where specialist staff have sufficient time built-in for quality
assurance, and are able to draw on expertise and experience across government
and beyond
> * adequate controls, including a clear governance framework

### Process

> * clear guidance that sets out the key considerations driving the approach to
quality assurance
> * clear documentation about the analysis and the quality assurance process
