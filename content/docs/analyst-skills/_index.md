# Analyst skills

I'm looking at the issue of analyst skills in the Nottinghamshire ICS with some other people at the moment. The brief is:

* Consider the types of analyst teams within the ICS and their diverse functions
* Identify a generic set of skills for healthcare analysts in the region
* Identify extra skills necessary dependent on role and organisation
* Identify individuals within the ICS who can provide training on these skillsets
* Identify gaps where the system is not self sufficient for training and procure training (preferring free training)
* Look at the range of external training available to the system
* Identify areas of training need that cannot be met internally or externally

This will quite obviously require a very large amount of information about analyst skills, careers, and training, and so I will be making notes as I go along here. There may be a couple of things that come out of this that I can't share, thinking in particular of other people's thoughts and ideas, but I'll share as much as I can and hopefully this will prove a useful resource for somebody else doing the same thing in another part of the country (or world, even :wink:)

## Summary of content

Presented here will be material concerning:

* [Types of analytic team]({{< ref "team-types.md" >}})
* Types of analyst (TODO)
* A generic set of skills for analysts in each type of team (TODO)
* A review of training available to ICS staff (TODO)

Some of the other material may end up being on internal documents but it wouldn't be of interest to those outside our organisation anyway.
