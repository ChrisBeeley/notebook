# Analyst skills

I'm looking at the issue of analyst skills in the Nottinghamshire ICS with some other people at the moment. The brief is:

* Identify a generic set of skills for healthcare analysts in the region
* Identify extra skills necessary dependent on role and organisation
* Identify individuals within the ICS who can provide training on these skillsets
* Identify gaps where the system is not self sufficient for training and procure training (preferring free training)
* Look at the range of external training available to the system
* Identify areas of training need that cannot be met internally or externally

This will quite obviously require a very large amount of information about analyst skills, careers, and training, and so I will be making notes as I go along here. There may be a couple of things that come out of this that I can't share, thinking in particular of other people's thoughts and ideas, but I'll share as much as I can and hopefully this will prove a useful resource for somebody else doing the same thing in another part of the country (or world, even :wink:)

## Ideas

* Repeat the PHE skills audit exercise, possibly with some tweaks to add more detail
* Consider the multiplicity of "analysts" and the different skillsets they imply
