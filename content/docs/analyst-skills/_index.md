# Analyst skills

I'm looking at the issue of analyst skills in the Nottinghamshire ICS with some other people at the moment. The brief is:

* Consider the types of analyst teams within the ICS and their diverse functions
* Identify a generic set of skills for healthcare analysts in the region
* Identify extra skills necessary dependent on role and organisation
* Identify individuals within the ICS who can provide training on these skillsets
* Identify gaps where the system is not self sufficient for training and procure training (preferring free training)
* Look at the range of external training available to the system
* Identify areas of training need that cannot be met internally or externally

This will quite obviously require a very large amount of information about analyst skills, careers, and training, and so I will be making notes as I go along here. There may be a couple of things that come out of this that I can't share, thinking in particular of other people's thoughts and ideas, but I'll share as much as I can and hopefully this will prove a useful resource for somebody else doing the same thing in another part of the country (or world, even :wink:)

## Summary of content

Presented here will be material concerning:

* [Types of analytic team]({{< ref "team_types.md" >}})
* Types of analyst (TODO)
* A generic set of skills for analysts in each type of team (TODO)
* A review of training available to ICS staff (TODO)

Some of the other material may end up being on internal documents but it wouldn't be of interest to those outside our organisation anyway. 

## Appendix A: Ideas 

* Looking at the difference between domain knowledge (MH, acute, maternity...) and analytic knowledge (stats, ML, R...)
* Consider the case where analysts have skills that they're not able to use

Where is the focus?

1.	ICS Strategic Analytics team
2.	The strategic analytical needs of the ICS to be met by the above and contributions from partner organisation teams
3.	All analysts in an ICS meeting ICS and organisational needs

[I think largely 2 + 3, but for discussion]

What types of analysis are we considering? 

1.	clinical decision-making to help busy clinicians diagnose and manage disease
2.	innovation and change in the NHS, and to evaluate the success of new models of care and whether changes deliver the expected benefits
3.	effective board-level oversight of complex organisations and care systems
4.	better everyday management of the monitoring and improvement of the quality and efficiency of care
5.	senior decision-makers to respond better to national incentives and regulation
6.	the allocation of finite resources
7.	better understanding of how patients flow through the system
8.	new data and digital tools
9.	patients and the public in using information

### Domains

As well as _dataset_ type (acute, mental healthcare, etc.) there are domains of analytic task. The SAIU has been restructured to include the following interest groups:

*	Demand and Capacity
*	Population Health Management
*	Health Inequalities
*	Transformation and Efficiency
*	Place based partnerships

### Scope

* Explicitly wider than healthcare and include social care as well
* PH intelligence analysis and PHM are separate types of analysis to the Performance/ Data analysis/ reporting/ Data science split given elsewhere
* Need to include supporting the system with strategically allocating resources and interventions to maximise benefit
