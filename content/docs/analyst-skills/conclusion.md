# Conclusion

## Scope

In order to carry out this work within a reasonable timeframe it was scoped to exclude any detailed work on career and competency frameworks (which are in any case forthcoming nationally).

(Are we going to add any more scope to this?)

## Outline

The current piece of work is designed to carry out the following functions as presented in the introduction: 

* Consider the types of analyst teams within the ICS and their diverse functions
* Identify a generic set of skills for healthcare analysts in the region
* Identify extra skills necessary dependent on role and organisation
* Identify individuals within the ICS who can provide training on these skillsets
* Identify gaps where the system is not self sufficient for training and procure training (preferring free training)
* Look at the range of external training available to the system
* Identify areas of training need that cannot be met internally or externally

These areas will each now be considered in turn.

## Consider the types of analyst teams within the ICS and their diverse functions

The type and function of analytic teams across the ICS is clearly broad. They might be though of as falling roughly into one of four types:

* Performance
* Data analysis/ reporting
* Data science
* Public health/ population health 

## Identify a generic set of skills for healthcare analysts in the region

## Appendix A: Ideas 

Where is the focus?

1.	ICS Strategic Analytics team
2.	The strategic analytical needs of the ICS to be met by the above and contributions from partner organisation teams
3.	All analysts in an ICS meeting ICS and organisational needs

[I think largely 2 + 3, but for discussion]

What types of analysis are we considering? 

1.	clinical decision-making to help busy clinicians diagnose and manage disease
2.	innovation and change in the NHS, and to evaluate the success of new models of care and whether changes deliver the expected benefits
3.	effective board-level oversight of complex organisations and care systems
4.	better everyday management of the monitoring and improvement of the quality and efficiency of care
5.	senior decision-makers to respond better to national incentives and regulation
6.	the allocation of finite resources
7.	better understanding of how patients flow through the system
8.	new data and digital tools
9.	patients and the public in using information
