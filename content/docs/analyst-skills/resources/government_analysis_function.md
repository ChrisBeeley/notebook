# Government Analysis Function (AF) Learning Curriculum

## Summary

[This document](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-analysis-function-af-learning-curriculum) is designed for analysts across the civil service. It is available under the [OGL3](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/). 

It is divided into five areas:

* Ability
    * Gain aptitude or potential to perform to the required standard – “I need to learn how to do something now”
* Technical
    * Demonstrate specific professional skills, knowledge or qualifications – “I want to get better at doing something”
* Behaviours
    * Actions and activities that people do which result in effective performance in a job – “I want to change a behaviour”
* Strengths
    * The things we do regularly, do well and that motivate us – “I want to learn from the experiences and strengths of others”
* Experience
    * The knowledge or mastery of an activity or subject gained through involvement in or exposure to it – “I want to experience something that will help me grow”

## 70 : 20 : 10 learning model

The learning opportunities on the Learning Curriculum are grouped according to the 70:20:10 Learning Model. This framework suggests that in the workplace:

* 70% of learning is experiential. It happens through daily tasks, challenges and practice
* 20% of learning is social. It happens with and through other people, like colleagues
* 10% of learning is formal. It happens through structured training courses and programs

This is a key insight in the current context and elsewhere and illustrates how important it is to:

1. give analysts opportunities to practise their skills
1. give analysts the opportunity to network and learn from each other

Formal training makes up a very small proportion of the value in learning.
