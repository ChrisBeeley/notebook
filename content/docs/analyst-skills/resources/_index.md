## Resources

Please note the resources are reproduced in the repo with permission and no permission to reproduce elsewhere is implied (although asking nicely usually works, in my experience :wink:).

Sources include (links forthcoming, I hope): 

* [Advancing analytics in the NHS]({{< ref "advancing_analytics.md" >}})
* [Recommendations for advancing the analytical capability of the NHS and its ICS partners]({{< ref "analytics_ics.md" >}})
