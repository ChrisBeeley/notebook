# Competency frameworks

## Introduction

[APHA](https://www.aphanalysts.org/) carried out a [review of competency frameworks](https://www.aphanalysts.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Competency-Framework_Discovery_Report_V1.9.pdf) for health service analysts, published in 2021. There were 28 competency frameworks considered in the review, of which 10 were found to contain significant detail about analytical job roles and career progression. Some of the material from this review and from the competency frameworks is presented below. 

They assessed four frameworks as being the highest ranked in the scoring that they designed:

* [Government Analysis Career Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/analysis-function-career-framework/government-analysis-function-career-framework-html-version)
* [NHS KSF](https://www.nhsggc.org.uk/media/231230/Abbreviated%20KSF%20guidance.pdf)
* [AphA Professional Registration Criteria](https://www.aphanalysts.org/professional-registration/)
* [Civil Service Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-competency-framework)

They note that despite the high score the skills within the KSF relating to analytics are out of date and that framework will not be discussed any further here. 

Other notable frameworks they reviewed include:

* [The Clinical Informatics Framework](https://facultyofclinicalinformatics.org.uk/core-competency-framework)
* [The digital, data, and technology profession capability framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework)
* [EDISON Data science framework](https://edison-project.eu/sites/edison-project.eu/files/filefield_paths/edison_ds-bok-release2-v04.pdf)

## The digital, data, and technology profession capability framework

This framework is [reviewed elsewhere in this notebook]({{< ref "service-standards.md" >}}) from the perspective of the synergy of the roles within it with the data science family.
