# Skills

A full description of a typology of skills and an associated [competency framework]({{< ref "competency_frameworks.md" >}}) is out of the scope of this work, nonetheless a rough framework is presented here to give structure to the discussion about the types of training that might be useful. This can be added to in the future when more national work has been carried out with regards to competency frameworks and careers in health and care analytics. There are several dimensions of interest in this context:

* Health and care domain knowledge (MH, acute, maternity...)
* Analytic knowledge (stats, ML, R...)
* Analytic task (demand and capacity, population health management)

## Health and care domain knowledge

It may not be useful to list these exhaustively since there are so many possibilities and levels of hierarchy that could be used to describe this, but it might be worth describing the domains broadly.

## Analytic knowledge

This is the level that this work most obviously concerns and warrants a reasonably comprehensive description (although not at the level forthcoming from national work on competency frameworks)

## Analytic task

As well as _dataset type_ (acute, mental healthcare, etc.) there are domains of _analytic task_. The SAIU has been restructured to include the following interest groups:

*	Demand and Capacity
*	Population Health Management
*	Health Inequalities
*	Transformation and Efficiency
*	Place based partnerships

This is thought to provide a useful structure to the current piece of work.
