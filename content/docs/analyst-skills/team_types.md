# Team types

## Summary

Broadly, we might think of three types of analytic team within the ICS:

* Performance
* Data analysis/ reporting
* Data science
* Public health/ population health 

The roles of these teams is discussed in more detail following. Quoted content comes from the [data job family](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework#data-job-family) which is licensed under the OGL3.

## Performance

[Performance teams](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/performance-analyst): 
> …develop performance measurement frameworks - key performance indicators (KPIs), goals, user needs and benefits - and analyse the performance of a service or product against these, adapting your approach and framework appropriately and in line with any changes

Tools and approaches

* SPC
* RAG ratings
* Board level summaries of KPIs

## Data analysis and reporting

[Data analysts](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/data-analyst):

> “apply tools and techniques for data analysis and data visualisation (including the use of business information tools), collect and migrate data to and from a range of systems manage, clean, abstract and aggregate data  alongside a range of analytical studies on that data manipulate and link different data sets summarise and present data and conclusions in the most appropriate format for users”

Tools and approaches

* PowerBI/ Qlik/ Tableau
* Benchmarking
* SPC
* Statistical analysis
* SQL

## Data science

[Data scientists](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/data-scientist)

> ...use data to identify and solve complex business problems. They have an interdisciplinary focus, using techniques and knowledge from a range of scientific and computer science disciplines (for example, statistics, analytics, machine learning)

Tools and approaches

* R/ Python/ Julia/ SQL
* Time series analysis/ forecasting
* Statistics (especially e.g. regression models, GAMs, GEEs, etc.)
* Machine learning
* Natural language processing
* Open tooling/ version control

## Public health/ population health 

[Population Health Management](https://imperialcollegehealthpartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Population-Health-Management-Flatpack-Version-1.0-Final-Sent.pdf):

> ...improves population health by data driven planning and delivery of proactive care to achieve maximum impact.
> It includes segmentation, stratification and impactabilty modelling to identify local ‘at risk’ cohorts - and, in turn, designing and targeting interventions to prevent ill-health and to improve care and support for people  with ongoing health conditions and reducing unwarranted variations in outcomes

Tools and approaches

* Segmentation
* Health economics
* Public health and epidemiological analysis
* Impactability modelling
* Population health profiling
* Opportunity analysis
