# Where does NHS-R fit?

Brilliantly, NHS-R is already leading on many of the things from this review that are important to me. I'm going to highlight the stuff we already started doing, with nobody asking us to, and a paltry amount of funding, and then I'm going to talk about the stuff that we can make a really solid contribution to tomorrow if we're brought in to the conversation (which, according to the review, we should be).

[if you're reading this and you're not me, these are just notes for now. I will make it less scrappy]

## What has NHS-R already done?

* NHSA 19. Create and maintain a curated national open library of NHS analyst code
    * A wonderful [open repo](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/demos-and-how-tos) full of all kinds of useful stuff in the R language

## What can NHS-R do in the future?

* NHSA 11. Devise the content of a national training programme for NHS analysts: initial and CPD
    * NHS-R wouldn't be expected to contribute across the board, but NHS-R includes many experts in:
        * RAP
        * dashboard programming
        * programming for statistics and machine learning
        * Git, GitHub, and collaboration
        * Training in data science methods
* NHSA 12. Oversee funding and delivery of training, both open online and one-to-one
