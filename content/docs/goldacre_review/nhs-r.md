# Where does NHS-R fit?

Brilliantly, NHS-R is already leading on many of the things from this review that are important to me. I'm going to highlight the stuff we already started doing, with nobody asking us to, and a paltry amount of funding, and then I'm going to talk about the stuff that we can make a really solid contribution to tomorrow if we're brought in to the conversation (which, according to the review, we should be).

[if you're reading this and you're not me, these are just notes for now. I will make it less scrappy]
