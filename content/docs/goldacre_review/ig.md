## Summary

> "Our experience suggests that IG processes are a ubiquitous challenge in delivering timely and high-quality research with the potential to make a positive impact on health. Currently, such processes are often lengthy, circuitous, opaque, and inconsistent, in a way that creates duplication and wastage of time and effort and is not proportionate to the nature or degree of risk involved."

### LAUNCHES QI study

"LAUNCHES QI, a project initiative in 2018, aimed to link 5 national data sets to generate understanding about Congenital Heart Disease services, with the intention to: describe patient trajectories through secondary and tertiary care; identify useful metrics for driving quality improvement; and explore variation across services...

In total 47 documents were required for the data application processes, comprising 384 pages. These were required by 11 data controllers or departments and submitted 162 times in total. Each application form asked for similar study information, but each required different wording, structure, and detail, and some seemed unfit for purpose – designed for clinical trials and other interventional studies involving human participants and ill-adapted to data-only studies. The resulting confusion meant that each data controller asked for alterations and further information between one and 9 times before approval was given. This was all in addition to getting research ethics approval from the HRA and gaining Section 251 approval.

Gaining permissions, including university and ethical approval, took 8 months, and the data applications took between 3 and 7 months. Acquiring the data took a further 7 to 10 months. Once this linkage was completed, the researchers received further funding to start a new – but related – study on the same dataset. The approval process to re-use the dataset took a further 2 years and..."

## Information governance processes

"the collection, storage and use of health data is governed by a multi-layered set of overlapping, duplicative and sometimes contradictory policies, regulations, and ethical guidelines managed by the Department of Health and Social Care, the National Data Guardian, the ICO, the Health Research Authority, Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority (MHRA), NHS Digital, NHS England, the NHS Transformation Directorate, local trusts, individual universities, GPs, hospitals, and a range of other bodies granted powers by the preceding organisations"

> "Even if I or other experienced researchers know how one bit of the forest works, navigating the complexity of the multiple regulators and sources of approval is what befuddles researchers (and the public)"

There is good evidence that research and other useful activities are being unnecessarily hindered by current practice, and there is work ongoing (e.g. the [Information Governance Portal](https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/information-governance/guidance/)) to simplify it.

### An overabundance of caution

> "Sometimes people don’t understand the rules so it’s easier for them to say ‘the data protection law won’t allow me to share data with you.’ Usually, the data protection law would actually say you can share as long as you do xyz."

> "Lots of people will say the GDPR is a blocker. It wasn’t supposed to be. It was supposed to be about sharing data. The blockers are all interpretations. Some of it is there are too many independent bodies."

There are multiple causes of excesive caution in this context, including:

* Anxiety caused by a belief that patients are against data sharing
* Anxiety caused by a lack of determinacy in information governance rules
* Anxiety caused by the mechanisms used for data access
    * "...data dissemination requires decision-makers to trust the recipients of data, and is inherently more risky than TRE access"

### Monopolies, resource, and recognition

> "Monopolies over data are one of the largest hurdles that must be overcome…“Guarding” of data, be it for reasons of commercial advantage, academic competitiveness or resistance to the idea of commercial involvement, is harmful to collaboration and only adds expense or prevents research outright. This hampers the effective use of data and stifles innovation (by both public and private sector organisations)."

There are issues around incentivising of the collection, curation, and sharing of data, and it is very much not the case that the cost to the sharing organisation is zero. In summary:

* It is inappropriate for information governance processes to be used to obstruct data access for other reasons
* People who have invested time and effort on collecting or managing data that is widely used should be able to access resource to make their work for all sustainable
* Data collection and curation should be regarded as independent skilled activities with status on a par with writing final data reports
* The marginal additional costs on an organisation when sharing data should be priced appropriately, and passed on appropriately

### Anxiety about performance management, and public accountability
