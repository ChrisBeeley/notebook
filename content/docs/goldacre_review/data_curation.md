> The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) have said that they estimate 80% of all work on an analysis project using NHS data is spent on this data preparation, and they have previously recommended that 80% of the national resource deployed on data science in the NHS should therefore be spent on optimising data curation

## The problem

Even for something as simple as hypertension there are hundreds of definitions and SNOMED codes that some individuals may think do (or don't) constitute hypertension. 

"Creating these lists is therefore complex and difficult work. To do it, the team need a number of skills which may not all be embodied in one individual. They will need domain knowledge about clinical medicine, to spot the need to include a code such as “arteriolar nephritis”. They will also need domain knowledge about how health data works: they will need to know what SNOMED-CT codes are, how they can be searched, how codes are nested within a poly-hierarchy (and then challenging details such as how parent-child relationships in the poly-hierarchy can create overlapping conflicts, which can in turn change when individual codes move between nodes in different releases); they also need knowledge of how clinicians use clinical systems, what is recorded, how it is coded, and what the strengths and weaknesses of the data are (collectively this is often called “clinical informatics”)"
