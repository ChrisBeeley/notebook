# What should Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust do

Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust (NHC) is part of an [analytically able ICS](https://healthandcarenotts.co.uk/) and employs three analytical teams with good working relationships: Applied Information, Performance, and CDU data science. The teams combine expertise in data curation and management, performance and quality surveillance, and data science methods and analytical pipelines. 

NHC could become one of the "data pioneer" trusts (or form part of a "data pioneer" ICS) that the report recommends in [NHSA 7](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/better-broader-safer-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis/better-broader-safer-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis#modernising-nhs-service-analytics) by building on the work already happening at the trust.

## Open code

* Actively seek permission to open source code that refers to database schema from proprietary databases. [OpenSAFELY](https://www.opensafely.org/) publishes code from databases produced by [TPP](https://tpp-uk.com/) ([with their permission](https://github.com/nhsx/open-source-policy/issues/6#issuecomment-1138403404)), and NHC should do the same, as well as approaching the other main EHR database vendor the trust has engaged, [Servelec](https://www.servelec.co.uk/) (regarding the [Rio database](https://www.servelec.co.uk/product-range/rio-epr-system/))
