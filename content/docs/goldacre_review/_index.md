# Better, Broader, Safer: Using Health Data for Research and Analysis

These are my notes from the material in the [Goldacare Review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/better-broader-safer-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis). Please note that if you're not me and you're reading this I am only making notes about the bits that particularly pertain to me as a data scientist working in an NHS provider trust. For example, I think trusted research environments are a great idea, but it's not of particularly great interest to me in terms of my work, so I'm skimming over those bits. I'm interested in how we use data at the coalface from within an organisation (or ICS, IG permitting) and in particular how we use data to inform decision making and ensure that staff and patients are getting the best outcomes possible (clinical and experiential).

Note that the material is provided under the [OGL version 3](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/), and I am complying with the licence by reusing the material with proper attribution and a link to the licence. I read a lot of stuff, code and prose, that is produced with public money without an open licence so I would like to take this opportunity to thank the authors and publishers for opening the material in this way.

[verbatim from document]

* How do we facilitate access to NHS data by researchers, commissioners, and innovators, while preserving patient privacy?
* What types of technical platforms, Trusted Research Environments (TREs), and data flows are the most efficient, and safe, for which common analytic tasks?
* How do we overcome the technical and cultural barriers to achieving this goal, and how can they be rapidly overcome?
* Where (with appropriate sensitivity) have current approaches been successful, and where have they struggled?
* How do we avoid unhelpful monopolies being asserted over data access for analysis?
* What are the right responsibilities and expectations on open and transparent sharing of data and code for arm’s length bodies, clinicians, researchers, research funders, electronic health records and other software vendors, providers of medical services, and innovators? And how do we ensure these are met?
* How can we best incentivise and resource practically useful data science by the public and private sectors? What roles must the state perform, and which are best delivered through a mixed economy? How can we ensure true delivery is rewarded?
* How significantly do the issues of data quality, completeness, and harmonisation across the system affect the range of research uses of the data available from health and social care? Given the current quality issues, what research is the UK optimally placed to support now, and what changes would be needed to optimise our position in the next 3 years?
* If data is made available for secondary research, for example to a company developing new treatments, then how can we prove to patients that privacy is preserved, beyond simple reassurance?
* How can data curation best be delivered, cost effectively, to meet these researchers’ needs? We will ensure alignment with Science Research and Evidence (SRE) research priorities and Office for Life Sciences (OLS) (including the data curation programme bid).
* What can we take from the successes and best practice in data science, commercial, and open source software development communities?
* How do we help the NHS to analyse and use data routinely to improve quality, safety and efficiency?

### Key principles

Good defaults- make good practice the norm, not the exception

* Open 4. Create an ‘exceptions framework’ whereby publicly funded code can be closed [only by] by prior arrangement if this meets NHS and UKplc strategic objectives
