## Open source

I constantly talk about open source and regurgigate the same links to policy and best practice over and over again so it has finally dawned on me that I should just write it down once and then, you guessed it... open source it. So here it is.

(I may expand this into a whole section in time but let's start with the basics)

### Policy

* Guidance on sharing code from GDS:  https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/making-source-code-open-and-reusable
* The NHS version of the above:  https://service-manual.nhs.uk/service-standard/12-make-new-source-code-open
* Sharing code being talked about in NHSXâ€™s data saves lives strategy document:  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-saves-lives-reshaping-health-and-social-care-with-data-draft/data-saves-lives-reshaping-health-and-social-care-with-data-draft#helping-developers-and-innovators-to-improve-health-and-care

### Guidance

* https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-source-guidance/security-considerations-when-coding-in-the-open
* https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/09/04/the-benefits-of-coding-in-the-open/
* https://medium.com/healthfdn-data-analytics/towards-open-health-analytics-our-guide-to-sharing-code-safely-on-github-5d1e018897cb

### Awesome repos that show how it's done

(although note some of these are imperfect e.g. they lack licences)

- The superb, world leading coronavirus dashboard from PHE https://github.com/publichealthengland/coronavirus-dashboard
- An analysis of risk factors for COVID deaths across 17 million linked NHS records https://github.com/opensafely/risk-factors-research

- A tool to calculate growth centiles for children, developed by RCPCH https://github.com/rcpch/digital-growth-charts-server
- The NHSX/ NHSR funded R wrapper to our locally developed tool to classify text based patient experience data (this is from my team ðŸ˜Š) https://github.com/nhs-r-community/pxtextmineR
- An experimental bed allocation tool from NHSX https://github.com/nhsx/skunkworks-bed-allocation
- Open source SQL that produces the MHSDS from NHSE https://github.com/nhsengland/MHSDS

(This is really just a completely rushed random snapshot. If you know about something cool in open source health and social care, get in touch or make a PR :relaxed:)
