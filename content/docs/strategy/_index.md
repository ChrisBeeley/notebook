## Introduction

[My Trust](https://www.nottinghamshirehealthcare.nhs.uk/) is writing some strategy at the moment and I'm writing some stuff about analytic strategy. A lot of this stuff seems to be done in bunkers without any sharing (sound familiar? :wink:) so I thought I'd publish the notes that I'm making and whatever I write. 

## Information sources

There are two main sources of information within this document- NHSX's excellent Data Saves Lives and East Kent and Medway's analytics strategy, which are both shared freely online

* [Data saves lives](https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/key-tools-and-info/data-saves-lives/)
* [East Kent and Medway strategy](https://democracy.kent.gov.uk/documents/s96055/Analytics%20-App1.pdf)
