# Nottinghamshire Healthcare

Given the other published materials, what should be the priority for Nottinghamshire Healthcare? There follows the key elements of the strategy followed by more detail about each.

* Population Health Intelligence
* Driving innovation and quality
* Whole system demand and capacity intelligence
* Intelligent decision support for clinicians

## Population health intelligence

* Analytics should consider:
    * Mental and physical wellness
    * Factors that contribute to wellbeing such as loneliness and employment
    * Inequalities in health outcomes and service provision
* Consider impactability:
    * Start with a robust evidence base
    * Evaluate what treatments work for whom
    * Feed evaluation information back to clinicians to guide their clinical practice
    * Robust evaluation and high quality clinical practice should feed back into research through peer reviewed publication


## Driving innovation and quality

* Produce a strategy across QI, evaluation, research, audit, CDU, and applied information and facilitate
* Workforce plan across clinicians, managers, and analysts in embed QI, statistical, and data science methods in everyday practice
* Provide a joined up service, provoke curiosity across the workforce and triage questions across the range of data and analytic services with a single point of access
* Analytics should be provided at a whole system level and should be easily shared, reproducible, and self service
    * Data and analysis should be 

## Whole system demand and capacity intelligence

* Contribute to building capacity in the ICS to routinely carry out demand and capacity modelling
* Develop a system wide approach to demand and capacity, including models of patient flow and early warning systems

## Intelligent decision support

* Provide legible, real time, analytically robust PROMS, CROMS, and PREMS to all staff who need them
* Continue to use and build on success of data science methods such as forecasting and text mining
* Consider implementing [CogStack](https://cogstack.org/) to support text mining of clinical notes in the EHR
