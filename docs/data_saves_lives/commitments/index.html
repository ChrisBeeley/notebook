</h3>
<ul>
<li>We will work with expert partners and the public to implement secure data environments as a default across the NHS.</li>
<li>We will work with the public to establish, for the first time, a data pact that will set out how we will use health and care data, and what the public has the right to expect.</li>
<li>We will co-design a transparency statement, as part of a regularly updated online hub, setting out how publicly held health and care data is used across the sector.</li>
<li>We will lead the work of the Health and Care Information Governance Panel to develop additional information governance guidance, including the first part of the information governance frameworks for integrated care covering individual care and standards (such as data-sharing and transparency), so the public can be confident in our handling of their data, to be published on the information governance portal.</li>
<li>We will establish an expert advisory group drawn from a wide range of stakeholders from across health and adult social care with whom we will co-design a robust and detailed plan for rebuilding public trust, including commitments set out here, and provide a check and challenge function to make sure we never fall below the ambition and standard set out in this strategy.</li>
<li>We will agree, with the expert group, how we will transparently measure and monitor levels and drivers of public trust so that all organisations using health and care data have up-to-date information about the public’s attitudes to data use.</li>
<li>We will develop a central portal for data partnerships guidance for healthcare leaders and seek feedback ahead of a wider roll-out.</li>
<li>We will publish the value sharing framework, which will support the health system to deliver good data partnerships.</li>
<li>We will update the 5 principles to include the adult social care sector.</li>
<li>We will develop commercial principles to ensure that partnerships for access to data for research and development have appropriate safeguards, and benefit the public, and the NHS and NHS Digital’s template contracts for access to data will be reviewed to ensure they are consistent with these principles.</li>
<li>We will develop a standard for public engagement, setting out best practice for health and care organisations, and any other body using NHS data, to engage appropriate with the public and staff across the system on data programmes and issues.</li>
<li>We will undertake in-depth engagement with the public and professionals through forums such as focus groups with seldom-heard groups, and large-scale public engagement on topics and questions that are high priority or particularly complex, including how we deliver secure data environments and the future of the national data opt-out, and working closely with regions to understand local needs.</li>
<li>We will work with local health and care systems and partners including integrated care systems, including co-designing regional engagement, to make sure that we understand the needs, concerns and opportunities for different communities across England.</li>
<li>We will work with the public, the expert advisory group, the National Data Guardian and other stakeholders to ensure that we have a simple opt-out system in place that provides clarity and choice, giving patients confidence, and ensuring data continues to support the functioning of the health and care system.</li>
<li>We will improve access to GP records in the NHS App by giving patients access to their latest health information (November 2022) and provide patients with the ability to digitally request historic coded information, including diagnosis, blood test results and immunisations.</li>
