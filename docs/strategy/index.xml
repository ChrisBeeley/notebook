      <description>Data Saves Lives #   Bringing people closer to their data  the ability, if I want, to share additional data I have collected to improve my wellbeing, such as sleep, food, exercise, and genome   Giving health and care professionals the data they need to provide the best possible care  have the data to make the right decisions and recommendations about their care all relevant information about people in my care, such as data about their sleep or physical activity, so I can have information-driven conversations about their care we will introduce legislation in due course to create a statutory duty for organisations within the health and care system to share anonymous data for the benefit of the system as a whole (ongoing)   Supporting local and national decision makers with data  plan or commission services to suit local needs, including areas that need support or improvement evaluate services and care, including safety risks and good practice manage vital management functions such as workforce planning we will pilot a data and analytics accelerator (March 2022) we will begin to make all new source code that we produce or commission open and reusable and publish it under appropriate licences to encourage further innovation (such as MIT and OGLv3, alongside suitable open datasets or dummy data) (end of 2021) we will use secondary legislation in due course to enable the proportionate sharing of data including, where appropriate, personal information for the purposes of supporting the health and care system without breaching the common law duty of confidentiality   Improving data for adult social care  (nothing for me here)   Empowering researchers with the data they need to develop life-saving treatments, models of care and insights  (nothing particular here but this is a useful general point)   Helping colleagues develop the right technical infrastructure  have quick access to the information I need to plan and run my systems effectively drive interoperability across the health and care system by: having clear and open standards making it easier to share data safely and efficiently understanding the wider data architecture so I can build and buy the right systems have clear cybersecurity guidance to make sure that my systems and the data held within them is as safe as possible Data architecture principles  All data will be validated at the point of entry to improve data quality All data will be made discoverable Data will not be duplicated All clinical data stored will be made accessible using APIs published on the API gateway People will be able to self manage any data relating to their contact details and personal preferences Organisations should be able to self-manage any data relating to them, for example locations and types of services offered Data should be digitally signed to an appropriate level     Helping developers and innovators to improve health and care  clear guidance on data partnerships which maximise benefits to citizens and the system open standards, code, APIs and systems architecture so that my innovations will easily and effectively work across the system adequate documentation of the data and the APIs, and appropriate visibility on prior work that uses them clear understanding of any regulatory, data protection, data handling and cyber security obligations, so that I know how to build these in at the beginning of my project a speedy and simple approvals process for my application to interact with health and care data, so that I can get it out to users quickly clear route maps to deploy technology at scale across the system, so that my solution has the best chance to seamlessly integrate into care pathways and frontline ways of working publish a digital playbook on how to open source your code for health and care organisations with guidance on where to put the code, how to license and what licences to use, how to maintain and case studies of teams who have done this (2021) collaborate with the MRC, NIHR, and UK Research and Innovation to ensure that grants for research involving health and care data follow open and reusable code principles (ongoing) support up to 100 AI companies through the AI in Health and Care Awards to achieve market authorisation and/or the real world evidence required to support long-term NHS commissioning of their technology (March 2026) make £140 million of funding available through the AI in Health and Care Award to accelerate the testing and evaluation of AI technologies (2024) helping regulators develop an approach for independently validating AI technologies for screening (June 2022)    </description>

      <description>East Kent and Medway #  We will:
 Develop shared health and care analytics, which will enable us to understand the health needs of the population and to estimate how we can make the biggest improvements in improving health outcomes, patient experience, cost efficiency, workforce wellbeing and reducing health inequalities Examine the bigger picture of the drivers of good health and provide an understanding of the relationship and variation between care received throughout different points in an integrated care system Design how to move from reactive care to preventative care, through the use of prescriptive rather than descriptive analytics to provide a more holistic view of a patient’s requirements and care Develop the new and collaborative ways of working across organisational health and care boundaries needed to deliver the changes that our patients and communities need  Strategic goals</description>

      <description>Nottinghamshire Healthcare #  Given the other published materials, what should be the priority for Nottinghamshire Healthcare? There follows the key elements of the strategy followed by more detail about each.
 Population Health Intelligence Driving innovation through research Whole system demand and capacity intelligence Intelligent decision support for clinicians  Population health intelligence #  Appendix A: Supporting plans
 Intelligence to support clinicians and care teams Research Evaluation Data architecture plan Data quality plan IG plan Analytical capacity plan  What can be stopped or optimised, and how we can work better   Giving people the skills they need to ask the right questions, interpret intelligence and turn it into action  </description>
