      <description>Recommendations for advancing the analytical capability of the NHS and its ICS partners #  This document is still under review by NHSEI but I have permission from the Strategy Unit to reproduce it here. Please note that the work is not being reproduced with an open licence and if you wish to share or remix this document you should contact the authors yourselves to seek their permission.
The executive summary is a pretty powerful statement and is worth reproducing in full (note again that these conclusions are currently under review at NHSEI).</description>

      <description>Modernising NHS service analytics #  Summary of recommendations #  [TBC]
Introduction #  &amp;ldquo;At present there is no formal professional body (but some outstanding grass roots organisations); very little formal structure around teaching and training, or ‘continuing professional development’; and a general lack of clear technical job descriptions or qualifications specific to NHS service analytics that managers without technical skills can use to evaluate the skills mix that they have, or need, in their service.</description>

      <description>East Kent and Medway #  We will #   Develop shared health and care analytics, which will enable us to understand the health needs of the population and to estimate how we can make the biggest improvements in improving health outcomes, patient experience, cost efficiency, workforce wellbeing and reducing health inequalities Examine the bigger picture of the drivers of good health and provide an understanding of the relationship and variation between care received throughout different points in an integrated care system Design how to move from reactive care to preventative care, through the use of prescriptive rather than descriptive analytics to provide a more holistic view of a patient’s requirements and care Develop the new and collaborative ways of working across organisational health and care boundaries needed to deliver the changes that our patients and communities need  Strategic goals #   Population Health Intelligence  We will develop intelligence to plan and commission services based on what will offer the most value for individuals, considering every aspect of their health and wellbeing, proactively preventing poor health and being ready to best manage it when it happens.</description>

      <description>Nottinghamshire Healthcare #  Given the other published materials, what should be the priority for Nottinghamshire Healthcare? There follows the key elements of the strategy followed by more detail about each.
 Population Health Intelligence Driving innovation and quality Whole system demand and capacity intelligence Intelligent decision support  Population health intelligence #   Analytics should consider:  Mental and physical wellness Factors that contribute to wellbeing such as loneliness and employment Inequalities in health outcomes and service provision   Consider impactability:  Start with a robust evidence base Evaluate what treatments work for whom Feed evaluation information back to clinicians to guide their clinical practice Robust evaluation and high quality clinical practice should feed back into research through peer reviewed publication    Driving innovation and quality #   Produce a strategy across QI, evaluation, research, audit, CDU, and applied information and facilitate joint working between them Workforce plan across clinicians, managers, and analysts in embed QI, statistical, and data science methods in everyday practice Provide a joined up service, provoke curiosity across the workforce and triage questions across the range of data and analytic services with a single point of access Analytics should be provided at a whole system level and should be easily shared, reproducible, and self service  Data and analysis should contribute to &amp;ldquo;intelligent transparency&amp;rdquo;  Accessible Comprehensible Usable Assessable- that is, open for inspection      Whole system demand and capacity intelligence #   Contribute to building capacity in the ICS to routinely carry out demand and capacity modelling Develop a system wide approach to demand and capacity, including models of patient flow and early warning systems  Intelligent decision support #   Provide legible, real time, analytically robust PROMS, CROMS, and PREMS to all staff who need them Continue to use and build on success of data science methods such as forecasting and text mining Consider implementing CogStack to support text mining of clinical notes in the EHR  Appendix A: Related areas</description>

      <description>Open source #  Introduction #  As discussed in an earlier chapter, section 12 of the NHS service standards compels those who follow it to &amp;ldquo;Make new source code open&amp;rdquo;. Elsewhere, the NHS is being enjoined to use (as well as produce) open source software (REF). Using free software sounds like an obvious thing for a public sector body to do, and open sourcing its own code and allowing other bodies to make use of it also sounds on the surface like a sensible approach.</description>

      <description>Open working #  Myths about open working #  This section starts with mythbusting, which is very welcome because there is a lot of rubbish spoken about open code in the NHS. To summarise:
 Adopting open working practices does not mean other countries or industry can exploit intellectual property created with state funds: there should be a robust and thoughtful exceptions framework to impose commercial licenses or restrictions on review and (separately) re-use of publicly funded code, where this is actively helpful; but this closed approach should be used in a planned and deliberate fashion, where it meets national strategic objectives, not as the unplanned default approach  I&amp;rsquo;m not 100% clear on what is intended by this- but if it was I imagine (dual licensing) I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about the practicalities of this one     </description>

      <description>Team types #  Summary #  Broadly, we might think of three types of analytic team within the ICS:
 Performance Data analysis/ reporting Data science Public health/ population health  The roles of these teams is discussed in more detail following. Quoted content comes from the data job family which is licensed under the OGL3.
Performance #  Performance teams:
 …develop performance measurement frameworks - key performance indicators (KPIs), goals, user needs and benefits - and analyse the performance of a service or product against these, adapting your approach and framework appropriately and in line with any changes</description>

It is divided into five areas:
 Ability  Gain aptitude or potential to perform to the required standard – “I need to learn how to do something now”   Technical  Demonstrate specific professional skills, knowledge or qualifications – “I want to get better at doing something”   Behaviours  Actions and activities that people do which result in effective performance in a job – “I want to change a behaviour”   Strengths  The things we do regularly, do well and that motivate us – “I want to learn from the experiences and strengths of others”   Experience  The knowledge or mastery of an activity or subject gained through involvement in or exposure to it – “I want to experience something that will help me grow”    70 : 20 : 10 learning model #  The learning opportunities on the Learning Curriculum are grouped according to the 70:20:10 Learning Model.</description>

      <description>Competency frameworks #  Introduction #  APHA carried out a review of competency frameworks for health service analysts, published in 2021. There were 28 competency frameworks considered in the review, of which 10 were found to contain significant detail about analytical job roles and career progression. Some of the material from this review and from the competency frameworks is presented below.
They assessed four frameworks as being the highest ranked in the scoring that they designed:</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m going to highlight the stuff we already started doing, with nobody asking us to, and a paltry amount of funding, and then I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about the stuff that we can make a really solid contribution to tomorrow if we&amp;rsquo;re brought in to the conversation (which, according to the review, we should be).</description>
