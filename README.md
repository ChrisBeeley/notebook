# Notebook

I make notes on various things that I find interesting or useful, and thoughts it would be useful if I could show people, or if they could even stumble on them and find them useful.

By its nature, the stuff in this repo has a mixture of licences. There's quite a lot of OGL stuff in there, and you'll find there I link the original source.
